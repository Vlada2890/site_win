    <em>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  <p><b>Ancient Origins</b></p>
      <p><i>Wine production dates back thousands of years, with evidence of winemaking found in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. The oldest known winery was discovered in Armenia and dates back to around 4100 BC.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <p><b>Health Benefits</b></p>
      <p><i> Moderate wine consumption has been associated with various health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Red wine, in particular, is known for its potential health-promoting properties due to its antioxidant content, including resveratrol.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <p><b>Wine and Religion</b></p>
      <p><i>Wine has played a significant role in various religious and cultural traditions. For example, it is used in Christian sacraments such as Holy Communion, and it has symbolic importance in Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu rituals.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <p><b>Wine Bottle Shapes</b></p>
      <p><i>Wine bottles come in various shapes and sizes, each with its own history and purpose. For example, the Bordeaux bottle with its high shoulders is commonly used for red wines, while the Burgundy bottle with its sloping shoulders is used for white and lighter red wines. Sparkling wines typically come in thicker, heavier bottles to withstand the pressure of carbonation.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    <p><b>Aging Potential</b></p>
      <p><i>Some wines are known for their ability to age and develop complex flavors over time. Fine wines from regions such as Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Napa Valley can age for decades, with some reaching their peak flavor profile after many years of cellaring.</i></p>
